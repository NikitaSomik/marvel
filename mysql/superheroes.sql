(2, 1, 'Black Panther', 'T\'Challa', 'T\'Challa is a descendant of an ancient royal dynasty that has ruled the country for many years, Wanda, lost in the African jungle. His father, T\'Chaca, was one of the most prominent kings in the history of Wakod and the first Black Panther. He was able to provide a technological breakthrough to his country, making it one of the most developed not only in the region, but all over the world. T\'Chaca was the first to begin developing a valuable vibrinium, a fictional metal of extraterrestrial origin. This vibranium also destroyed T\'Chaca: mercenaries led by Ulysses Claw came and tried to stage a coup d\'état. T\'Chaka was killed, and only the intervention of a very young T\'Challa helped to stop the invaders and save Wakand. So the boy became king.\r\nMany decided that Wakida would now become easy prey, and T\'Challa had to defend his country from constant attacks. The young king could only rely on himself - and eventually he became a brilliant fighter, inheriting from his father the mantle of the Black Panther. Applying and his talent for science, he repeatedly beat off attacks. But T\'Challa realized: constantly defending himself, Wanda is doomed to collapse in the end under the pressure of the conquerors. He went to America, where he enlisted the support of the Avengers and even joined this team.\r\nReturning to Wakand, T\'Challa brought the country out of isolation, making it an important part of world politics. Later he married Ooro Monroe, better known as Storm, a member of the X-Men team. For a while, the Black Panther and Groza were members of the Fantastic Four, replacing Reed and Susan Richards. As a result of the attack of the forces of Doctor Dumas T\'Challa fell into a coma, and the mantle of the Black Panther was adopted by his younger sister Shuri. In the fifth volume he will return.\r\nA little later T\'Challa became a new Man without fear at the request of Daredevil. As a result, he still defends \"Infernal Cuisine\" from the mafia and other supervillains.', 'The physical strength of T\'Challa is significantly higher than that of the average person at the peak of development, he is able to raise just under 800 pounds (362.8 kg). T\'Challa can reach speeds of up to 35 miles per hour (56,327 km / h). T\'Challa musculature emits less fatigue toxins than most people. His body can heal injuries that would be fatal to ordinary people. The dexterity of T\'Challa is also increased to the peak of human development.\r\nT\'Challa can see in total darkness as if it was a clear sunny day, a few hundred feet away he sees objects as if they are directly in front of his face. T\'Challa\'s hearing is strengthened in the same way that it allows him to hear sounds that ordinary people are not able to hear, and are also able to hear at greater distances that an ordinary person can not hear. T\'Challa can memorize tens of thousands of smells and track them in the exact place, and can also smell fear. T\'Challa\'s taste is developed so that he is able to determine the exact ingredients of a particular food that he eats.\r\nAs King Wakid, the Black Panther has the right to eat a special form of heart-shaped grass, which gives him superhuman feelings and increases his strength, speed, endurance and agility. However, later T\'Challa refused this privilege.', '“They knew death was better than bondage.”', '26d216ad76293e82690b0b5a2cc32344.jpg', '2018-06-28 20:56:11', '2018-06-28 20:56:11'),
(3, 1, 'Captain America', 'Steven Rogers', 'Stephen Rogers was born on July 4, 1918 in Brooklyn, New York, to the family of Irish emigrants Sarah and Joseph Rogers. By the early 1940s, before America entered World War II, Rogers was a short and lean student-artist specializing in illustrations. Outraged by Hitler\'s rise to power, Rogers tried to join the army, but was denied because of his weak physical form. The US Army officer, who was looking for the guinea pig, offered Rogers a chance to serve his country by taking part in a top-secret defense project - Operation Revival, whose goal was to develop the means to create physically hardy and strong soldiers. Rogers agreed to research and after a rigorous selection was selected as the first subject for the Super Soldier serum, developed by Dr. Joseph Reinstein, whose name was later retroactively replaced by Avraham Erskine.', 'Captain America possesses superhuman strength, as a result of the action of the serum of the super-soldier and the processing of the vita-rays, he was transformed from a weak youth into a \"perfect\" model of human development and state. Strength, stamina, agility, speed, reaction and strength of the Captain are at the peak of human capabilities. It was found that the body of Rogers regularly produces the serum of the super-soldier; it does not disappear.\r\nThe formula strengthened all of its metabolic functions and prevented accumulation of fatigue poisons in the muscles, giving it endurance far beyond the ordinary human. This explains many of his extraordinary feats, Rogers is able to raise 5 tons and run miles per minute. Moreover, its amplification is the reason why it was able to survive, being frozen for decades. Rogers also can not get drunk on alcohol and is immune to many diseases, because he heals faster than an ordinary person. Thanks to accelerated reflexes and combat experience, Steve can dodge bullets.\r\nCombat experience and preparation of Rogers make him an expert in tactics and an excellent field commander: his companions periodically obey his orders in battle. The reaction and feelings of Rogers are also extremely sharp. He is a master of many martial arts. Years of practice with its indestructible shield made it possible to throw it with almost unerring accuracy - it can attack multiple targets in succession with one throw or even arrange a boomerang-like return from the throw to attack the enemy from behind. In the comics, other experienced fighters consider him one of the best hand-to-hand fighters in the world.\r\nRogers has extensive military training and was often shown familiar with the continued high-security operations of the US Department of Defense. He is an expert on military strategy, survival, acrobatics and management of various transport. Despite his high reputation as one of the most popular and recognizable superheroes, Rogers also has many acquaintances in the espionage environment, in large part due to his continued work on the organization SHCHI.T. From time to time he tries himself in the field of \"secular\" career including applied arts, drawing comics, education (history of higher education) and law enforcement activities.', '\"Avengers Assemble\"', 'SRyYQZ.0.0.jpg', '2018-06-28 21:27:51', '2018-06-28 21:27:51'),
(5, 1, 'Doctor Strange', 'Dr. Stephen Vincent Strange', 'Stephen Strange was a talented neurosurgeon, but at the same time he was a man of self-love and presumptuousness. Strange could become a famous physician, but got drunk on one solemn evening, and then, getting home, got into a car accident: Steven failed to control the car, and she crashed into a pillar. He receives severe damage to both hands, because of which Stephen\'s career as a neurosurgeon ended.\r\nWanting to remain a doctor, the future master of mystic science goes on a journey around the world in search of a means of healing for his hands. While traveling, Strange learned about one person named Elder, who lives in Tibet and is able to perform miracles. The Elder refuses to heal Stephen, he says that he must study magic and find healing himself. Angered by failure, Strange is about to leave the castle of the Elder, but as he passes by one of the rooms, he sees the disciple of the Elder, Baron Mordo, who is preparing to kill his master. Stephen warns the Elder about the impending assassination attempt, thereby saving the wizard life. Mordo flies from the castle of the Elder, who offers Strange to become his new disciple.', 'Dr. Strange is a very powerful wizard who draws his strength from such mystical beings as the three Vishanti - Hoggot, Oshtur, Agamotto; Octessens is a group of 8 creatures including Balfak, Sittorakka, Farallah, Iconna, Krakkana, Raggadorra, Valtorra and Vatumba. In addition, he owns the most valuable magical artifacts, including the cloak of levitation, the Eye of Agamotto, which is used to neutralize dark magic, the Book of Vishanti, which contains spells of white magic, and Shar Agamotto (there is a time stone in it).\r\nIn addition, Stephen - a gifted surgeon, who in a short time was able to become one of the best in his profession. The main specialization of Strange is neurosurgery (a section of surgery that deals with operational management of diseases of the nervous system). After Stephen got into a car accident and injured his hands, he lost the opportunity to continue his professional career. Nevertheless, Strange is still able to perform the duties of an assistant or mentor surgeon. For seven years, Stephen studied occultism and magic under the direction of the Elder. Returning to New York, Strange continued to engage in self-education. Stephen studied martial arts with the monks of Kamar-Taj (Kamar-Taj). These skills have often helped the wizard in cases where he could not use magic. Strange also trained his students in the hand-to-hand combat.\r\nStephen Strange is considered the most powerful magician in space. According to Eternity, he is stronger than any other humanoid. Strange wore the title of Supreme Magician from 1983 (after the death of the Elder), with the exception of the period from 1992 to 1995. He refused the title in 2009, but in 2012 he proved that he can save the world without him.', '\"By the Hoary hosts of Hoggoth\"', 'strange.0.jpg', '2018-06-29 10:56:26', '2018-06-29 10:56:26'),
(6, 1, 'Daredevil', 'Matthew Michael Murdoch', 'Matt Murdoch was born on May 30, 1990 in the family of boxer Jack Murdoch, nicknamed \"The Fighter\". His mother Maggie suffered post-birth depression and because of this intermittently harmed the baby, not wanting that. So she left her husband and son, becoming a nun, and Jack raised Matt himself. Later, already an adult, Matt found his mother and forgave her.\r\n\r\nMatt grew up in Hell\'s Kitchen, one of the criminal districts of New York. Matt began to study for a lawyer, and one day he saved a blind old man when he nearly fell under the wheels of a truck. But the radioactive liquid that the truck drove hit Matt\'s eyes. This incident forever blinded Matt, but improved his hearing, sense of smell and touch. He trained with the blind martial artist Stik and became a great fighter. Another incident affected Matt\'s life. His father was killed by the agents of the criminal Fixer (Roscoe Sweeney), who tried to get Jack to voluntarily lose the fight. Furious that the official system could not do anything with the crime, Matt created a suit from his father\'s fighting gown and took the name \"Daredevil\". He beat his father\'s killers, and the frightened Fixer died of a heart attack. Matt founded a small law firm with his friend Foggy Nelson. He began to serve the law as Murdoch\'s lawyer and fight crime as Daredevil.', 'Superhumanly developed sense of touch: Matt\'s touch is so sensitive that he can touch the printed page of the book and feel its contents. In addition, he immediately feels any fluctuations in atmospheric pressure and temperature changes, which in fact allows him to anticipate the weather. Even if you deprive him of his sense of smell and hearing, he will still be aware of the presence of a person in the room at a distance of five feet, feeling the heat emanating from him and the vibrations of the air. The side effect of the ability is that Matt feels not only external changes, but internal, which allows him to manipulate internal organs, muscle contractions, etc. This makes it possible in an instant to bring your reflexes and strength to the peak of human possibilities.\r\nSuperhumanly developed sense of smell: the scent of Daredevil is so developed that it can distinguish at a distance of identical twins from differences in smell. He recognizes a lot more smells than an ordinary person, literally dividing them into millions of particles. Memory for smells allows him to recognize people after a long time, even if he spent only a couple of minutes with this person. Masking your own smell is also useless, from Matt\'s scent this will not save. He can concentrate on the smell of one particular person and follow him on the heels through the crowd.\r\nSuperhumanly developed hearing: like all other sense organs, Matt\'s hearing impresses with its sensitivity. He can hear the heartbeat of a person more than twenty feet from him, recognize and understand the whispers of people talking on the other side of the standard soundproof wall. Thanks to long training and practice, Daredevil has learned to control his ears, block the flow of all unnecessary sounds, such as his own breathing or heartbeat, filter the noise of streets and concentrate strictly on a certain source. The downside of this ability is that, taken by surprise, Daredevil may suffer much more than the average person from too loud a sound. In addition, a crowd of people is too large a source of sensory impressions and therefore Matt may simply not understand the flow of information pouring into him.\r\nThe lie detector: according to changes in the heartbeat and other indicators, Daredevil can determine whether a person is telling him the truth or lying (however, the hero can mislead the presence of a pacemaker or a person\'s ability to control their emotions and heartbeat).\r\nIdentification of a person: at a certain heart rate and by the smell of a Daredevil can identify people.\r\nSuperhumanly developed sense of taste: A daredevil can taste all the components of food and drink that he uses. Also, he can easily remember a variety of tastes.\r\nSuperhumanly developed sense of balance: this is a general misconception, to consider that balancing does not pertain to feelings. The sense of balance in the Daredevil is developed at the same level as the Spider-Man.\r\nThe sense of \"radar\": Daredevil can determine the location of objects, their proximity and remoteness from themselves. According to one version, Matt\'s radar vision occurs with the help of the electromagnetic spectrum, when in some parts of the brain a signal is sent out, enveloping the objects and then returning back to the brain. According to another theory, the unusual sight of the Daredevil arises from a sore - he hears a weak echo when the sounds bounce off objects. His ability can work thanks to a combination of these two methods, or with the help of something third, which the common man is not known and is not available. In any case, with the help of this ability, Matt boasts an analogue of a three-dimensional human vision.\r\nAfter the ability was lost, Matt managed to partially restore her through training with Master Steek.\r\nTelepathy: thanks to the master classes of the blind Stic, Daredevil, demonstrate insignificant, but still telepathic abilities.', '\"Bullseye\"', 'netflix-daredevil-key-art.jpg', '2018-06-29 11:07:21', '2018-06-29 11:07:21'),

Carol was the best student at the Air Force Academy and quickly promoted, rising to the rank of major. Because of her performance, great fighting skills and natural intelligence, Carol was recruited in the intelligence sphere. So she went to the Central Intelligence Agency, during which she worked with Colonel Nick Fury. During the special appointment of Nick Fury, Carol met the Canadian agent Logan. They became partners and went through many adventures together. During one of their assignments, they encountered a cruel mutant Sabretooth, who worked for the Hellfire Club. Working together, Logan and Carol became close friends, as well as lovers. They both saved lives several times. When Carol was captured by the KGB, raped and imprisoned in Lubyanka, Logan was among those who challenged the law to save her.\r\nAfter working with the CIA, Carol came to work for NASA and became director of security at Cape Canaveral. It was in this position that Carol first met Mar-Vella, a warrior of an alien kriya race known as Captain Marvel. Carol was called to unravel the mystery of this alien soldier. During the investigation, Carol has a unique relationship with the alien, at first they become friends and then lovers. It is this relationship that will forever change the life of Carol.', 'Miss Marvel has superhuman strength, endurance and strength. It can withstand a pressure equal to 92 tons and strike with a similar level of strength. It is capable of flying at a speed equal to about half the speed of sound and shooting from the hands with energy charges. Also, Miss Marvel demonstrated the ability to absorb other forms of energy, such as electricity, to further increase her strength and energy projection, up to the strength of the nuclear weapons explosion.\r\n\r\nBeing a Double Star could take advantage of the energy of a \"white hole\" that allows manipulating stellar energy and, consequently, controlling heat, electromagnetic spectrum and gravity. Also had the ability to move with the speed of light and the ability to exist in a vacuum of space.\r\nCarol Danvers is also a well-trained spy, a highly skilled pilot and has an army hand-to-hand combat.', '\"Shazam!\"', 'brie_larson.jpg', '2018-06-29 11:12:35', '2018-06-29 11:12:35'),
(9, 2, 'Iron Man', 'Anthony Edward Tony Stark', 'The son of the wealthy industrialist Howard Stark, Tony was a brilliant inventor and mechanic. He inherited his father\'s business at the age of 21, turning the company into one of the leading manufacturers of weapons. Stark was wounded with a splinter in his chest during a field test of the suitability of combat armor, which was supposed to give soldiers combat capabilities. Stark took prisoner of the gun baron Wong Chu, forcing him to create weapons of mass destruction - only then Tony would receive the operation necessary to save his life.\r\nTogether with his comrade and former captive Ho Jinsen, Nobel Prize winner in physics, Stark began working on a modified exoskeleton equipped with heavy weapons. In a secret, even from Stark, Jinsen designed a protective chest plate to support the wounded heart of the inventor. Stark put on a suit to try to escape from captivity, but Professor Jinsen himself was killed in a decisive battle. He gave his life to the Iron Man to live.\r\nAfter defeating the gun baron, Stark returned to America and redesigned the suit. After inventing the story that Iron Man was his guard, Stark entered into a double life as a billionaire inventor and costumed adventurer. Early enemies sent spies and foreign agents in an attempt to steal Stark\'s armor and his military secrets. After a while, Stark stopped defending only his own personal interests. He also began to deal with issues of national and international security. The iron man even helped to found the Avengers and became the sponsor of their team.\r\nDespite the immense wealth, Stark\'s life is not flawless. Starting his career, he was forced to wear a breastplate all the time to protect his heart. Stark, in addition, a former alcoholic, and his personal life - a mess. In many cases, the Iron Man is the emancipation and sheath that he wears to keep the world around him.\r\nEnemies of the Iron Man took various forms, from conquerors with claims to world domination and corporate competitors to super-criminals and foreign agents seeking to surpass or steal its technology.\r\nStark grew up feeling the increasing responsibility for using his technologies around the world. Stark Interpraise broke off cooperation with the government, focusing on technologies that will improve people\'s lives.\r\nLearned in his youth to pay those who helped him live such a comfortable life, Stark founded many charitable foundations and institutions. With an increasing sense of responsibility, he reached a new level of growing up. Comparing his secret more with debt than with personal property, Stark decided to reveal to the world that he is an Iron Man. With the burden of double life on his shoulders, Stark found himself in an unfamiliar territory as one of the few publicly known heroes.\r\nTony Stark is an ardent fan of football.\r\nTony Stark is included in the ratings of Forbes. the richest fictional characters, where he takes 4 th place, his fortune is estimated at 12.4 billion dollars.', 'Millionaire Tony Stark gives superpowers his iron suit, resembling an exoskeleton. The outfit not only increases the armor and gives the possessor superhuman opportunities, but also is equipped with weapons: in boots and gloves there is a jet engine through which an Iron man can fly like Superman; Repulsor beams are on their hands, as well as rockets, lasers and flamethrowers are built into the superhero clothes of the inventor.\r\nIn addition, Stark\'s helmet can scan the terrain and send the received data to the headquarters, and the owner himself has a neural connection with the suit. But if the villains find Tony Stark by surprise when he is in the \"human form,\" the mechanic will give the criminals a head start by using hand-to-hand combat.', '\"Iron man... cause steel´s to expensive\"', '1530455065-apphoto_film_2013_preview2.jpg', '2018-06-30 10:51:37', '2018-07-01 11:27:00'),
(10, 1, 'Ghost Rider', 'Carter Slade', 'It is not known how the Ghost Rider (or, more specifically, the Ghost Rider) was a Texas ranger named Carter Slade, but he was fulfilling the duties of the Ghost Rider even before Mephisto made a deal with Johnny Blaze. As Slade himself said, he went to the service of Mephisto out of noble motives, to send to hell the souls of sinners who lingered on Earth. However, after the task in San-Wanganese, Slade betrayed his employer and disappeared with the contract for 1000 damned souls. To return the contract, Mephisto went to a deal with Johnny Blaze.', 'Demonic Transformation: At any time, the Ghost Rider can turn into a powerful demon. At this time, everything except the skeleton disappears, and the skeleton itself will be flooded with infernal flames. Initially, Blaise and Ketch could not control their transformations, but over time they still managed to tame the power of Vengeful Spirits. Now the brothers take the form of the Ghost Rider either on their own, or if the blood of an innocent person was shed somewhere nearby, but sometimes the transformation does happen by itself, for example, in a state of anger. Being in the form of the Spirits of Retribution, people receive many superhuman abilities.\r\nSuperhuman strength: The power of the Spirit of Retribution allows its master to lift a weight of over 25 tons.\r\nSuperhuman Stamina: Mystic energy that overflows the body and spirit of the Ghost Rider stops production of fatigue toxins. Therefore, being in demonic form, the owner of the Spirit of Retribution possesses infinite endurance, can never eat, drink, or sleep.\r\nSuperhuman Stability: The Ghost Rider is immune to any physical damage. He does not feel pain and is able to survive when falling from a huge height. The spirit of retaliation comfortably feels at extreme temperatures, in places with high and low pressure, under water and in open space (it does not need to breathe). Fire, electricity, all sorts of poisons are absolutely harmless to him. Since the body of the Ghost Rider only consists of a skeleton, then the bullets do not harm him, and thanks to the infernal flame most of the bullets melt, even without reaching him. If bullets reach his body, they simply flatten out about him, not doing any harm at all, since from a constant stay in hellfire his skeleton is covered with carbon and became incredibly durable. Ghost Rider is vulnerable only to the magic of great power and to divine artifacts.\r\nRegeneration: Despite the strength of the skeleton, with long shooting from a large-caliber weapon, limbs will begin to fly away from it. But the mystic energy filling the body of the Ghost Rider allows him to heal any wounds instantly. He is also able to restore lost limbs. And also can recover from almost nothing\r\nHellfire: Phantom racer is able to cause a hellfire from Hell itself. It can emit flames by any part of the body, be it eyes, mouth, hands, feet, and so on. The spirit of Retribution is also capable of charging fire with any weapon, giving it an inexhaustible ammunition and increasing its power to grandiose rates. By concentrating the flame with your whole body, the Ghost Rider can cause a fiery storm that can destroy everything in its path. The power of hell fire is so great that even the Hulk could not resist it.\r\nHealing: Thanks to the blue flame of Arnor (the fire that Zaratos used as an angel), one can cure the injured person. He also knows how to resurrect the dead\r\nFeeling the presence of evil: The Ghost Rider is able to sense evil from a distance. This same ability helps him feel that the blood of an innocent person has been shed, but does not allow to know who owns the blood and whether the owner is alive.\r\nFiery Double: During the battle with the Ghost Riders, Blaze created several of his own counterparts, completely consisting of fire. The strength of the clones is equal to the strength of their master. Clones even have their own consciousness. The only limitation is that they can not even think about attacking the master.\r\nAbsorption of Power: Ketch can take the power of other Ghost Riders. Having absorbed the spirit of retribution, it becomes powerful at times. However, this ability has a very significant drawback: the more Ketch takes power, the more difficult it is for him to control himself. So, having absorbed too much power from the other Ghost Racers, he dies.\r\nPunitive Eye: Ultimate weapon of the Ghost Rider. If the Spirit of Retribution is close to the enemy, he can use the Penitent Eye: after looking into the eyes of the Ghost Rider, the villain experiences a horrendous pain equal to that which he caused throughout his life to other people. But this force has many limitations:\r\nThe sight acts only on those beings who have a soul.\r\nThe ability only affects people and beings who have two eyes. That is, the complete absence of eyes, or the presence of only one eye or, on the contrary, several, protects from the Punisher Eye.\r\nThe force acts only if the gaze is directed directly into the victim\'s eyes, thus, for example, the carriers of the symbiote - like Venom and Carnage are protected, since the symbiote replaces their eyes.\r\nThe gaze does not affect beings with a split soul or a multitude of personalities, such as the Hulk. (Therefore, for example, you can not kill a Racer by placing a mirror in front of him - he has a split personality).\r\nThe eye does not act if the person he\'s been using does not repent, such as Punisher, Wolverine, or Deadpool, even if it\'s a mutant or a cyborg (it does not work or the victim ignites instantly).\r\nPenitent Eye can be used even in outer space, for example, against Galactus or Thanos, but is not capable of killing it.\r\nTeleportation (by comics): to Hell and the World of the Living.\r\nTransformation of transport: The Ghost Rider is able to make any transport fire, such as a locomotive, a car, a train or an airplane.\r\nForesight: Also the Ghost Rider is able, \"virtually\" in hell, to see his future (but only for 3 days ahead) and the future of other people, and indeed of the whole Earth (for 3000 years ahead).\r\nLevitation: The Ghost Rider is able to stay in the air at a height of up to 5 meters. Moreover, even his gait on the verge of levitation - he leaves no traces.', '\"Rash fools! They believe me a mere human!
